The Biggest Likkle Superpower

<p>A documentary about Howard Sun - taxi driver and poet.</p>

<p>In late 2013, Howard Sun picked us up in his taxi. It became immediately apparent that he was unlike any other taxi driver we’d ever met. Infectiously hilarious and full of amazing stories, he recited a poem that he’d written called ‘Jamaica, The Biggest Likkle Superpower’ about his beloved home nation. We decided that we wanted to help Howard get his poem heard, as well as giving him a chance to share a few of his stories. This film is the result of that taxi ride.</p>

<p>A longer excerpt from the poem can be found <a href="http://vimeo.com/100312481">here</a>.</p>
